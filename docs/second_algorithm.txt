Random – Simulated Annealing – District 1
We finished the algorithm, but we still need to determine the best temperature and/or number of iterations. 
For the preliminary analysis we used a semi-random temperature of 320. At first, we used the formula e^(-highest diff / temp ) = chance to determine our temperature, 
where our “highest difference” is 459 based on the longest connection a house can have to a battery. 
Chance was based on an arbitrary number between 0 and 1, and we chose 0.2. However, we wanted to play around with the temperature and thus decided to increase it to 320. 
We noticed that when we increased the number of iterations, the algorithm accepted failure more often than with a lower number. 
For now, we tried an iteration number of 10.000 where T = 320. When we ran it N = 30 times, we ended up with an M = 58733.8 (SD = 280.91). 
Compared to our baseline, where the mean total costs were 77226.811 (SD = 1552.183), simulated annealing gives considerably better results. 
We ran it for 2h24m, and we are planning on running it for even longer.
