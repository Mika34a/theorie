Random algorithm - SmartGrid
Merel Florian, Michael Verdel, Joshua van Zanten 
We made a random algorithm that connects houses to batteries with capacity left. The list of houses and the list of batteries that are used to loop through,
are randomly ordered every time the algorithm is run. Therefore, we believe that the algorithm is mostly without bias. 
The algorithm will run until a solution is given in which all houses are connected to a battery. The only thing that is assumed is that every house 
can be connected with the Manhattan distance one way or another. 
A sample was performed (N = 30) to get a baseline. The mean total costs were: 77226.811 (SD = 1552.183). 
Every sample of the total cost is different, which means that the total length of connections differs every time. 
We made sure that the total amount of connections stayed 150, to ensure that the difference in total length of connections is totally explained by the length of the connections. 
If this baseline is correct, we will be happy with any result lower then 75674.628.
