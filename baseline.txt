Baseline - Smartgrid

We made a random algorithm that connects houses to batteries with capacity, 
if they still have capacity left. It is random because the list 
of houses and the list of batteries that are used to loop through are 
randomly ordered every time the algorithm is run. 
The algorithm will run untill a combination of connenctions is
found that leaves no houses unconnected. We believe that our algorithm is mostly without bias. 

The only thing that we assume, is that every house can be connected with the
Manhattan distance one way or another. This means that we did not yet implement the correct 
x and y coordinates for our connection points. Now the connection travels x steps 
to the side and y steps up or down.
